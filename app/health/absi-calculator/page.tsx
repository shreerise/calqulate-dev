    answer:
      "ABSI (A Body Shape Index) is a metric that combines waist circumference, BMI, and height to estimate health risk associated with body shape.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is ABSI calculated?",
    answer:
      "ABSI is calculated using the formula: Waist circumference / (BMI^(2/3) Ã— Height^(1/2)). This adjusts waist size for your height and weight.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is ABSI better than BMI?",
    answer:
      "ABSI provides additional insight compared to BMI, since it includes waist circumference. High ABSI values are associated with greater health risks, even if BMI is normal.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a high ABSI mean?",
    answer:
      "A higher ABSI score indicates that more body mass is concentrated around the waist, which is linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease and other conditions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I rely only on ABSI?",
    answer:
      "No single metric should be used alone. ABSI is best used alongside BMI, waist-to-height ratio, and professional medical advice.",

              <h2>Understanding ABSI</h2>
              <p>
                A Body Shape Index (ABSI) is a modern health metric that adjusts waist circumference for height and weight.
                Unlike BMI, ABSI highlights risks associated with abdominal fat, even in individuals with a normal BMI.
              </p>

              <h3>Why ABSI Matters</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Waist-Centric:</strong> Focuses on abdominal fat, a key risk factor for heart disease and diabetes.</li>
                <li><strong>More Insight:</strong> Complements BMI and waist-to-height ratio for better health assessment.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictive Power:</strong> High ABSI values are linked to increased mortality risk.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Using Your ABSI Score</h3>
              <p>
                ABSI should not replace medical diagnosis but can be a useful tool to understand your body composition.
                Always consult a healthcare provider for a full evaluation.
