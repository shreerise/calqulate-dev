    question: "What is a good waist to hip ratio?",
    answer:
      "A healthy WHR is generally considered to be below 0.90 for men and below 0.80 for women. Staying within these ranges suggests a lower risk of metabolic complications.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is WHR better than BMI?",
    answer:
      "Yes. WHR is often more accurate for assessing health risks because it measures your actual fat distribution, not just your overall weight. BMI cannot tell the difference between muscle mass and belly fat, but WHR shows exactly where your body stores risk-associated fat.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I reduce my WHR?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Yes, you can reduce your WHR by losing belly fat. This is usually achieved through a combination of regular cardiovascular exercise, targeted strength training, a healthy whole-food diet, and reducing refined sugars.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between waist ratio and hip ratio calculator?",
    answer:
      "They are often used interchangeably by users, but a true WHR specifically compares your waist size directly against your hip size to determine fat distribution. Both terms refer to the exact same formula.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does height affect WHR?",
    answer:
      "Not directly. Your height isn't used in the WHR formula. However, the waist-to-height ratio is another excellent metric that gives additional insight into your overall health risk.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is belly fat dangerous?",
    answer:
      "Excess abdominal fat (often called visceral fat) surrounds your internal organs. It actively releases hormones and inflammatory markers that increase the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and stroke.",
  },

                <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The <strong>Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR)</strong> is a simple yet powerful health metric that compares the size of your waist to your hips. It helps you understand fat distribution in your body, which is significantly more important than just tracking your overall weight.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Unlike BMI, which only considers weight and height, the waist ratio calculator focuses on <em>where</em> fat is stored — a key indicator of your metabolic health risks. A higher WHR means more fat around the waist (abdominal fat), which is closely linked to higher risks of heart disease, diabetes, and other metabolic issues.

                  Real User Dilemmas: Why Your Scale & Tape Measure Disagree
                </h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-8">
                  Whether you are calculating your Waist-to-Hip Ratio or your Waist-to-Height Ratio, mathematical calculators can sometimes give confusing results if you don't understand the context. Based on real questions from users just like you, here is what might be happening:
                </p>

                <div className="space-y-8">
                  {/* Skinny Fat */}
                  <div className="border-l-4 border-indigo-400 pl-6">

                      1. "My scale says I'm healthy, but the calculator says I'm at risk!"
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                      If you weigh a "normal" amount for your height (e.g., 60kg at 5'0"), but your waist ratio flags as moderate or high risk, you are likely dealing with a phenomenon called <strong>"Skinny-Fat"</strong> (Normal Weight Obesity). This means you have a healthy scale weight, but your body fat percentage—specifically visceral fat around your organs—is too high, while your muscle mass is too low.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-slate-700 mt-2 font-medium">
                      💡 <em>The Fix:</em> Shift your focus away from cardio and starving yourself. You need <strong>strength/resistance training</strong> to build muscle and improve your metabolic rate while burning that abdominal fat.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  {/* Underweight Flaw */}
                  <div className="border-l-4 border-blue-400 pl-6">
                    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">

                      2. "I'm 5'7", 147 lbs, and have a 26-inch waist. The calculator says I'm underweight?!"
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                      Many women with pronounced <strong>hourglass figures</strong> run into this issue. If you have a completely normal BMI but a very tiny waist relative to your height or hips, mathematical calculators might flag your waist ratio as "underweight" simply because the fraction is so small. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-slate-700 mt-2 font-medium">
                      💡 <em>The Reality:</em> A 25 or 26-inch waist at a healthy body weight is absolutely fine. Ratios are mathematical guides, not doctors. If you eat well, have normal energy, and your doctor is happy, you are not clinically underweight—you just have a slender waist.
                    </p>

                      3. "My waist increased by 8 inches in 6 months with NO change in diet. Should I worry?"
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                      Yes. If you experience rapid, unexplained weight gain concentrated strictly in your waistline without any changes to your diet or exercise routine, <strong>do not just rely on a calculator—see a doctor.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-slate-700 mt-2 font-medium">
                      💡 <em>The Reality:</em> Sudden abdominal expansion is often a red flag for hormonal imbalances (such as Thyroid issues, PCOS, or high Cortisol from chronic stress), medication side effects, or fluid retention. Get standard bloodwork done.

                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                      A staggering number of people measure their waist where their pants sit (the hip bone). <strong>This is incorrect and will ruin your calculation.</strong> Your true waist is the narrowest part of your torso, usually located slightly above your belly button.

                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                      If you are shorter (e.g., 4'8" or 5'2") and have a waist size over 40 inches, your health risk is elevated because abdominal fat puts strain on short frames. However, <strong>starving yourself is the worst possible solution.</strong> Starvation destroys your metabolism and eats away your muscle mass, making your body cling to belly fat even harder.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-slate-700 mt-2 font-medium">
                      💡 <em>The Fix:</em> Ignore body shamers. Your goal is health, not aesthetics. Start with 10,000 steps a day, prioritize protein to stay full, and make slow, sustainable changes you can maintain for life.
