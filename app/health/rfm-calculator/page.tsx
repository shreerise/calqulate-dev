// Updated FAQ data from your new content
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How accurate is RFM compared to BMI?",
    answer: "RFM correlates better with DEXA scan results (the gold standard) than BMI for estimating body-fat percentage. It misclassifies fewer people, especially women, because it focuses on fat distribution rather than just total weight."
  },
  {
    question: "Is RFM applicable for kids?",
    answer: "No, the RFM formula was developed and validated for adults. Children and adolescents require age- and sex-specific tools like pediatric growth charts. Always consult a pediatrician for assessing a child's body composition."
  },
  {
    question: "Does age or ethnicity affect RFM?",
    answer: "The core RFM formula is independent of age and has been shown to be effective across various ethnic groups in scientific studies. However, a healthcare professional will always interpret your results in the context of your personal health profile, which includes age and other factors."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I improve my RFM score?",
    answer: "To improve your RFM score (i.e., lower your body fat percentage), focus on sustainable lifestyle changes. This typically involves a moderate calorie deficit to encourage fat loss, combined with strength training and adequate protein intake to preserve muscle mass."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I measure my RFM?",
    answer: "If you are actively working on changing your body composition, measuring your RFM every 4 to 12 weeks is a reasonable timeframe to track meaningful progress. Measuring too frequently can be misleading due to normal daily fluctuations."
  },
  {
    question: "I searched 'how to calculate recency in RFM'. Is that related to body fat?",
    answer: "That's a common point of confusion! 'Recency, Frequency, Monetary' (RFM) is a completely different concept used in marketing to analyze customer behavior. Relative Fat Mass (RFM) for body composition does not involve 'recency' at all; it only uses your height and waist measurements."

                <p>Relative Fat Mass (RFM) is a simple, reliable method of estimating your percentage body fat using only your height and waist circumference. While BMI is based on total weight and can misclassify muscular individuals, RFM is specifically designed to measure fat accumulation.</p>
                <blockquote>RFM is more directly related to gold-standard DEXA scanning than BMI, making it a quick and clinically useful estimate of body fat without expensive equipment.</blockquote>
