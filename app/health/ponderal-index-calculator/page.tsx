    question: "What is the Ponderal Index?",
    answer:
      "The Ponderal Index (PI) is a measure of body leanness that adjusts for height more accurately than BMI. It is calculated as weight divided by height cubed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is the Ponderal Index different from BMI?",
    answer:
      "BMI uses height squared in its calculation, while PI uses height cubed. This makes PI a better measure for very tall or short individuals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Ponderal Index widely used?",
    answer:
      "PI is less common than BMI but is often used in neonatal and pediatric studies, as well as in certain body composition assessments.",

  {
    question: "What units should I use?",
    answer:
      "Enter weight in kilograms and height in centimeters. The calculator converts height to meters for the calculation.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a healthy Ponderal Index?",
    answer:
      "Unlike BMI, there are no universally accepted healthy ranges for PI, but values typically fall between 11â€“15 for adults.",

              <h2>Understanding the Ponderal Index</h2>
              <p>
                The Ponderal Index is calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) cubed. It improves upon BMI by
                taking height into account more precisely.
              </p>

              <h3>Why Use PI?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>More accurate than BMI for very tall or short people</li>
                <li>Commonly used in neonatal and pediatric research</li>
                <li>Helps assess body proportion in health and fitness</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>How to Use This Calculator</h3>
              <p>
                Enter your weight in kilograms and height in centimeters. The calculator will compute your Ponderal
                Index instantly.
