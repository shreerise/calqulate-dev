    question: "Is BMI accurate for men who go to the gym?",
    answer:
      "Not always. Muscle is denser than fat, so a man with a BMI of 27–28 might actually have 12% body fat and be in excellent health. The BMI scale was designed for sedentary populations. If you lift weights regularly, combine BMI with waist circumference and body fat percentage for a more complete picture. A waist under 35 inches with a BMI of 25–28 often indicates muscle, not fat.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a healthy BMI for women by age?",
    answer:
      "The standard healthy BMI range is 18.5–24.9 for all adults. However, women over 50 may carry slightly more fat due to hormonal changes — some research suggests a BMI of up to 26–27 carries no additional health risk post-menopause. Women under 30 benefit most from staying between 20–24. For women with PCOS or thyroid conditions, BMI alone is insufficient — consult your doctor.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is my BMI normal but I still have belly fat?",
    answer:
      "This is called 'normal weight obesity' or 'skinny fat.' BMI only measures total weight relative to height — it cannot detect where fat is stored. Visceral fat around the abdomen is metabolically more dangerous than fat stored elsewhere. Even at a normal BMI, a waist above 35 inches (women) or 40 inches (men) signals elevated health risk. A body fat percentage test gives you the real picture.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I calculate BMI in kg?",
    answer:
      "The BMI formula in metric units is: BMI = weight (kg) ÷ height² (meters). For example, if you weigh 70 kg and are 1.70 m tall: 70 ÷ (1.70 × 1.70) = 70 ÷ 2.89 = 24.2 BMI. That falls in the Normal Weight category. Our calculator does this instantly — just enter your weight in kg and height in cm.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the new BMI formula more accurate than the old one?",
    answer:
      "The new BMI formula proposed by Oxford mathematician Nick Trefethen (BMI = 1.3 × weight(kg) ÷ height(m)^2.5) corrects the traditional formula's known bias — it tends to overestimate BMI for tall people and underestimate it for shorter individuals. The AMA in 2023 also acknowledged that traditional BMI should not be used as the sole diagnostic criterion. Our calculator uses the standard WHO formula, but also shows the Ponderal Index as an additional metric.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I check my BMI?",
    answer:
      "Once every 2–3 months is ideal for most adults. Daily or weekly checks add anxiety without useful information — body composition changes happen over weeks, not days. Our save-results feature lets you track your BMI over time without logging in, so you can see real progress across your visits.",
  },
  {
    question: "What BMI is considered obese for women?",
    answer:
      "A BMI of 30 or higher is classified as obesity for adult women. This is further broken down: BMI 30–34.9 is Class I (moderate obesity), BMI 35–39.9 is Class II (severe obesity), and BMI 40+ is Class III (morbid obesity). A woman who is 5'4\" and weighs 174 lbs has a BMI of approximately 30. Health risks rise significantly above BMI 35.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does BMI differ for women after 40?",
    answer:
      "The BMI formula is the same, but what it means changes. After 40, metabolism slows, lean muscle declines, and hormonal shifts (especially perimenopause) often increase fat storage — particularly around the abdomen. Women over 40 may see their BMI drift upward even without major dietary changes. Strength training 2–3x per week and adequate protein intake (0.7–1g per pound of bodyweight) are the most evidence-backed ways to counteract this.",

                  What Is BMI? The Body Mass Index Explained Simply
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  BMI — or Body Mass Index — is a number calculated from your height and weight. It was developed in the 1830s by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet and later adopted by the WHO as a population-level screening tool. Today, the CDC adult BMI calculator and NHLBI both use the same formula to classify adults into four weight categories.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Here's the honest truth most websites skip: <strong>BMI is a starting point, not a verdict.</strong> In 2023, the American Medical Association (AMA) updated its official policy to clarify that BMI should not be used as a sole diagnostic measure — especially considering differences across gender, age, and ethnicity, including documented differences in African American BMI chart interpretation versus Asian populations. What BMI does well is give you a fast, free, and reasonably reliable signal about your weight category so you can take the right next step.

                <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Women checking their BMI face a unique challenge: the standard BMI chart was built primarily on male population data. While the categories apply equally, <strong>what those numbers mean in your body is different.</strong>
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Women naturally carry 6–11% more body fat than men at the same BMI — this is biological and normal, driven by estrogen, reproductive function, and fat distribution patterns. This means a woman with a BMI of 24 may have a higher body fat percentage than a man with the same BMI, yet still be in excellent metabolic health.

                  If you lift weights, play sports, or have a physically active job, your BMI calculator result may show "overweight" or even "obese" — while your actual body fat is perfectly healthy. This is BMI's most well-known limitation for men.

                  Here's a real example: a 5'11" man who weighs 195 lbs has a BMI of 27.2 — technically overweight by the BMI scale. But if his waist is 32 inches and he can run a 10-minute mile, he's in better cardiovascular health than someone with a BMI of 23 who sits all day. <strong>For men, BMI is most accurate when combined with waist circumference.</strong>

                  Walking is the most underrated fat-loss tool. Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that walking 7,000–9,000 steps daily reduces all-cause mortality by 50–70%. It doesn't spike cortisol, doesn't require equipment, and works at any BMI level. Here's a personalized walking plan based on your BMI result:

As you get older, your muscle mass naturally declines (a process called sarcopenia), your metabolism slows, and fat redistributes toward the abdomen. Two people can have identical BMIs at age 25 and 55 but wildly different health profiles.
