    question: "What is a good weight loss percentage?",
    answer:
      "A healthy target is losing 5% to 10% of your starting body weight over 3 to 6 months. Even at 5%, most adults see meaningful improvements in blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol. Anything more aggressive than 1% per week is generally not sustainable long-term.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I figure the percentage of weight loss?",
    answer:
      "To figure out percentage of weight loss, subtract your current weight from your starting weight, divide that number by your starting weight, then multiply by 100. The formula works the same in lbs or kg — just stay consistent with one unit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this a body percent weight loss calculator?",
    answer:
      "Yes. This tool is a body percent weight loss calculator that shows what portion of your original body weight you have lost. It does not measure body fat percentage specifically — for that you would need a body fat caliper, smart scale, or DEXA scan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this percentage of fat loss calculator in lbs and kg?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The lose weight percentage calculator works for both pounds and kilograms. The math gives the exact same percentage either way — a 10% loss is 10% in any unit. Just make sure both your starting and current weight use the same unit.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I calculate weight loss percentage?",
    answer:
      "Once a week is ideal. Daily weighing reflects water and food fluctuations rather than real fat loss, which can be discouraging. A weekly check on the same day, at the same time, and under the same conditions gives the most accurate trend.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is percent weight loss in newborns?",
    answer:
      "Percent weight loss in newborns is a clinical measurement used by pediatricians during the first week of life. Most newborns lose 5% to 7% of birth weight in the first few days, and a loss of more than 10% is considered a medical concern. This calculator is intended for adults — newborn weight loss should always be assessed by a healthcare provider.",

                  <strong>Weight loss percentage</strong> tells you how much weight you have lost compared to your <span className="bg-green-100 text-green-900 px-1.5 rounded">starting weight</span>.

                  Most people only track raw pounds or kilograms — but a 10 lb loss means very different things for someone who started at 150 lbs versus someone who started at 300 lbs. A <strong>body percent weight loss calculator</strong> normalizes that difference and gives you a metric that doctors, trainers, and clinical research actually use.

                    <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                      Probably not. <strong>0.5% to 1% per week</strong> is the medically recommended sustainable range, and many people lose less in the first few weeks because of water retention, hormonal shifts, or undercounted calories. A 1.5% loss in 3 weeks is right on track.

                      This is a classic <strong>weight loss plateau</strong>. As you lose weight, your body needs fewer calories to function — so the same diet that produced rapid loss at 200 lbs may produce zero loss at 184 lbs. Your maintenance calories have shifted.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-slate-700 mt-2 font-medium">
                      💡 <em>The Reality:</em> Recalculate your daily calorie needs at your new weight, add resistance training to preserve muscle, and consider a 1–2 week diet break to reset hormones before resuming a deficit.

                    <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                      Be cautious. Losing more than <strong>1% of body weight per week</strong> for an extended period typically means you are losing significant muscle mass and water — not just fat. This can damage your metabolic rate, weaken your immune system, and almost guarantees rebound weight gain.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-slate-700 mt-2 font-medium">
                      💡 <em>The Reality:</em> Rapid weight loss is rarely sustainable. If you have lost 15% in 6 weeks without medical supervision, slow down, prioritize protein (0.8–1g per pound of bodyweight), and get bloodwork done.

                      Always use your <strong>true original starting weight</strong> when you determine weight loss percentage. Using last week&apos;s number gives you a misleading short-term snapshot. The whole point of this metric is to measure long-term, total progress against where you began.

                      <strong>No.</strong> This tool is designed for adults tracking intentional weight loss. <em>Percent weight loss in newborns</em> is a medical assessment used by pediatricians during the first week of life — most newborns lose 5–7% of birth weight, and over 10% requires immediate medical attention.

You are closer to a clinically significant milestone than people realize.
