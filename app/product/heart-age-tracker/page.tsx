  faqs: [
    { q: "What is heart age?", a: "Heart age is an estimate of how old your cardiovascular system really is, based on your risk factors. A higher heart age than your real age means strain is adding years to your heart. Calqulate uses the validated Framingham model." },
    { q: "Why is my heart age older than my actual age?", a: "Usually one or more risk factors — high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar or smoking — are adding strain. It's very common: the CDC estimates the average American heart is about 7 years older than their real age." },
    { q: "How accurate is the Framingham heart-age model?", a: "It's a well-validated, widely used estimate, but it is an estimate, not a diagnosis. The model was developed and validated for adults aged 30–74, so results outside that range are less reliable. The most useful signal is the direction of travel over time." },
    { q: "Can I actually lower my heart age?", a: "Yes — heart age responds to the same things your risk factors do. As you bring down blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and blood sugar, the tracker shows the years coming back off, and tells you the highest-impact change to make first." },
    { q: "Is it free to start?", a: "Yes. Your first heart-age snapshot is free with no account. To save it and track the trend over time, plus the doctor-shareable report, Calqulate Vitals is one plan at $9.99/month or $79/year." },
    { q: "Is this medical advice?", a: "No. It's educational decision-support that helps you understand and track your cardiovascular risk and bring better questions to your doctor. It does not diagnose, treat or prescribe." },
    { q: "Is my data private?", a: "Yes. Your data is encrypted, backed up automatically and never sold. You can export everything or delete your account anytime." },
    { q: "Can I cancel anytime?", a: "Yes — one click, no retention maze. You keep access until the end of the period you paid for, and your data stays yours." },
