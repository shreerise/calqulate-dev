It is not diabetes, and it is not a diagnosis you're stuck with — it's a warning light on the dashboard. A1c reflects your average blood sugar over roughly the last three months, so a 5.7 means your average has been creeping up a little, not that something has broken.",

          "Yes — for the large majority of people, prediabetes is reversible, and that's the entire reason it's a separate category from diabetes. It's the window where lifestyle change does the heavy lifting and you can get your numbers back into the normal range without medication.",
          "On timing: A1c reflects roughly the last three months of blood sugar, so meaningful change shows up on a 3-month re-test, and many people pull their A1c back under 5.7% within 3–6 months of consistent effort. Weight loss of around 5–7% of body weight, regular movement, and cutting refined carbs and liquid sugar are the proven levers.",

          "The fix is straightforward but non-negotiable: hit a protein target (around 1.6 g/kg of your goal body weight is a common, evidence-based aim), lift weights two to three times a week so your body has a reason to hold onto muscle, and don't lose faster than roughly 1% of body weight per week. The drug creates the calorie deficit; your job is to aim that deficit at fat.",

        q: "How do I keep / protect muscle while losing weight on a GLP-1?",
        a: "Three things in order: eat enough protein (don't let appetite suppression crater intake), lift 2–3x a week so your body keeps muscle, and don't lose faster than ~1% of body weight per week. The drug handles the deficit; your job is to aim it at fat. Track lean body mass over time — that's what the GLP-1 Progress Tracker on Calqulate.net is for.",
        longAnswer: [
          "Protecting muscle on a GLP-1 comes down to three things, in priority order, and the good news is they're all within your control.",
          "First, protein. Appetite suppression is the whole point of these drugs, which makes it dangerously easy to under-eat protein specifically. Aim for roughly 1.6 g per kg of your goal body weight, and treat it as the one macro you don't skip, even on low-appetite days.",
          "Second, resistance training two to three times a week. This is the signal that tells your body to hold onto muscle while it's in a deficit. It doesn't need to be elaborate — basic compound lifts or even bands at home work. Without it, the body happily sheds muscle along with fat.",
          "Third, don't lose too fast. Aim for around 1% of body weight per week or less; faster loss tilts the ratio toward muscle. The drug creates the deficit automatically, so your job is purely to aim that deficit at fat with protein and lifting — and then to verify it's working by tracking lean body mass, not just the scale. That's exactly what the GLP-1 Progress Tracker on Calqulate.net is built to do.",

          "Many people regain weight after stopping Ozempic or Wegovy — but the ones who protected their muscle keep the most off. Here's how to de-risk the off-ramp, from Calqulate.net.",
        q: "Will I gain the weight back after stopping Ozempic / Wegovy?",
        a: "It's the #1 fear in every GLP-1 forum, and honestly: a lot of people do regain — but the ones who keep the most off protected their muscle on the way down and built real habits while on the drug. Muscle keeps your metabolism higher, so going in lean-mass-aware is your best insurance. Calqulate.net's GLP-1 Progress Tracker is designed for the off-ramp.",
        longAnswer: [
          "Let's be honest, because the forums already are: yes, a lot of people regain weight after stopping a GLP-1. Appetite returns, and if nothing underneath changed, the old patterns come back with it. Pretending otherwise doesn't help anyone.",
          "But the regain isn't uniform, and the difference between the people who keep most of it off and the people who bounce all the way back is largely predictable. The keepers did two things while on the drug: they protected their muscle on the way down, and they used the appetite-suppressed window to build habits (protein, lifting, movement) that outlast the prescription.",
          "Muscle is the key piece. It's metabolically active, so holding onto it keeps your daily calorie burn higher, which makes maintenance after stopping far more forgiving. Someone who lost 30 pounds of mostly fat with their muscle intact has a very different post-drug metabolism than someone who lost 30 pounds with a big chunk of muscle in there.",
          "So the smartest move is to go into the off-ramp lean-mass-aware and tracking the markers that matter — body composition and your heart and diabetes risk — not just the scale. Calqulate.net's GLP-1 Progress Tracker is designed specifically for this: protect the muscle, watch the risk numbers, and don't let months of effort quietly reverse.",

Calqulate Vitals runs a statistical model over your measurements to separate the real signal from the noise and tell you whether you're genuinely trending the right way — so you don't quit during a normal plateau.",
        longAnswer: [
          "Almost certainly yes, and the scale is just a terrible narrator of your progress. Body weight swings day to day on water retention, food in transit, sodium, hormones, and glycogen — and those swings can be several pounds, easily large enough to completely hide real fat loss or muscle gain for two or three weeks at a time.",
          "This is the exact moment most people quit. They've been disciplined for a month, the scale hasn't budged or even ticked up, and they conclude it isn't working — when in reality the fat is coming off and the scale is just lying through noise. It's one of the cruelest false signals in all of weight management.",
