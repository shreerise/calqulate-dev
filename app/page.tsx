const faqs = [
  {
    question: "I already use MyFitnessPal. Why do I need this?",
    answer:
      "Generic trackers are designed just for counting calories. Calqulate is built specifically for people on GLP-1 medications (Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro). We monitor the unique side effects of these meds—like rapid muscle loss, extreme drops in appetite, and metabolic changes—so you lose weight safely.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if I am losing muscle instead of fat?",
    answer:
      "The standard bathroom scale lies to you. Up to 30% of weight lost on GLP-1s can be muscle. Our Body Composition Tracker uses clinically validated inputs to show you exactly how much fat you are burning versus muscle, so you don't end up 'skinny fat'.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do you track 'Heart Age' and Labs?",
    answer:
      "Insurance companies and doctors require proof that your medication is actually making you healthier to keep refilling it. By tracking your labs and your 'Heart Age' in our app, you have undeniable proof that your internal health is drastically improving.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Founding Member Beta offer?",
    answer:
      "We just launched the GLP-1 suite! For our first 100 users, instead of a $9.99 monthly subscription, we are offering a one-time lifetime pass for just $49. No recurring fees, ever.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my medical data safe?",
    answer:
      "100% yes. We do not require an account for basic calculators, and for premium users, your data is never sold. You can export or permanently delete your health history with the click of a single button.",
