    { q: "What is the Metabolic Health Score?", a: "It's one composite score (0–100) built from peer-reviewed clinical equations — the Pooled Cohort Equations, Framingham and FINDRISC — that rolls up your cardiovascular, metabolic and body-composition picture. The methodology is shown on every result." },
    { q: "Is it accurate, and what's a good score?", a: "The score is built from validated published models, not a black box. Any single reading is an estimate, so the real value is the trend — re-check every few weeks and watch it climb. Higher is better, and the tracker shows which levers move it most." },
    { q: "What models is this based on?", a: "The Pooled Cohort Equations for 10-year ASCVD risk, Framingham for heart age, and FINDRISC for type-2 diabetes risk — all transparent, published models." },
    { q: "Is it free to start?", a: "Yes. Every calculator and your first metabolic snapshot are free, with no account and nothing saved. Calqulate Vitals adds saved history, the trajectory engine, the Future You simulator and your next-lever protocol." },
    { q: "What's the Future You simulator?", a: "A Monte-Carlo engine that projects your weight, score and heart age 6–60 months out across realistic, optimistic and pessimistic effort, with honest confidence bands." },
    { q: "Is this medical advice?", a: "No. Calqulate is educational decision-support that helps you understand and track your risk and bring better questions to your doctor. It does not diagnose, treat or prescribe." },
    { q: "Is my data private?", a: "Yes. Your data is encrypted, backed up automatically and never sold. You can export everything or delete your account anytime." },
    { q: "Can I cancel anytime?", a: "Yes — one click, no retention maze. You keep access until the end of the period you paid for, and your data stays yours." },
